# YonKaGor Wiki
The perfect wiki for all your information about our favourite fish lovin' furry musician, YonKaGor.

### **ALL INFORMATION TAKEN FROM THE [KENNYON FANDOM WIKI](https://kennyon.fandom.com/wiki/KennYon_Wiki)**

## General Info
Hi! This is just something I'm doing as a hobby because I have nothing better to do.

**Fandom sucks.** It's just full of ads and it sucks to use. Wouldn't it be great if you had a place for all your YonKaGor (Sorry Kenny) information? Introducing the [YonKaGor Wiki](https://yonkagor.wiki)! A place where you can get all the same information, minus the ads! I've tried my best to replicate the style and look of the Fandom Wiki, with some tweaks of course.

Now while it's not my intention for this to be a full on *replacement* for the Fandom Wiki, after all, the information will never ever be as up to date as it is on fandom, I do hope some people can use this as a simple way of viewing the same information, more comfortably.

_btw pls dont like analyse my code and make fun of it or smth pls im not that good ik the code sucks gimme a break this is like the first actual thing ive coded :c_

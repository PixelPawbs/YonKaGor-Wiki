	<div class="disclaimer">
		<p>Please note that <b>I did not collect ANY information in this wiki!</b> All of it has been taken from the dedicated folks over at the Kennyon Fandom Wiki. I was just frankly sick of fandom, so I decided to host my own Wiki. ALL information and images has been taken from them. I take absolutely no credit.</p>
		<p>Please also note that this wiki is currently in a <b>VERY UNFINISHED STATE</b>. Most pages haven't been done, and some stuff may appear broken. I am working on it!</p>

		<p>Welcome to the best hub for all you YonKaGor content! This is a small Wiki dedicated to hosting the best and most up-to-date content on YonKaGor songs, lyrics and characters, as well as song meanings and interesting trivia!</p>
		
		<p>(Note that this wiki may occasionally get information wrong or have information missing, I am one person after all! If you see any information you feel is wrong or missing, please let me know.)</p>
